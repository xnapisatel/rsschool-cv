## About myself ##
Worked at a special military equipment plant as an engineer for standardization and certification. At the moment I am taking courses on the frontend, studying HTML / CSS and JavaScript. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers. I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
